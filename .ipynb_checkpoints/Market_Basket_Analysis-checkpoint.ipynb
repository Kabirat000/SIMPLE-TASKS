In the context of MBA, an itemset could be {milk, bread, butter}.\n","\n","A metric is a measure of the performance of a rule.\n","\n","1. **Support**: The support of an itemset is the proportion of transactions in the dataset in which the itemset appears. It gives an indication of how frequently an itemset appears in the dataset.\n","2. **Confidence**: Given the rule (X→Y). The confidence of a rule is a measure of how often items in 𝑌 appear in transactions that contain 𝑋. It is an indication of the strength of the implication.\n","3. **Lift**: Lift measures how much more likely 𝑌 is to be bought when 𝑋 is bought, compared to 𝑌 being bought by itself. Lift values greater than 1 indicate a positive association, values less than 1 indicate a negative association, and values close to 1 indicate no association.\n","----"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QilzcvicC8SK"},"source":["## Quiz:\n","Given the following rule:\n","\n","$\\{bread\\} \\rightarrow \\{milk\\}$\n","\n","What is the antecedent and the consequent?\n","\n","**Note**: Many rules have multiple antecedents and consequents.
